WRONG ANSWER
```
select num
from my_numbers
group by num
having count(*) = 1
order by num desc
limit 1
```
上述答案无法满足题目条件：If there is no such number, just output null.
正确答案 
1. 用max 函数 若要输出null，需要满足两个条件，第一，select中应是聚合函数，第二，聚合函数处理的行数应为0。
2. 
select 
(
select num
from my_numbers
group by num
having count(*) = 1
order by num desc
limit 1)
as num;
